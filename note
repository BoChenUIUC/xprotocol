quic vs dumbprefetch vs drop vs prefetch
0. run all 5x

1.change interval from 11ms to 15ms and run drop/prefetch 5x

2. change the buffer to 3,6,10 and run prefetch 5x

we could possibly compare the predicition accuracy from either only past frame statistics and XACK info

better protocol for latency sensitive applications in assym net?

the delayed packets are of less value compared to the common case, so we want to make the prediction accurate.

the feedback at the server is slow so we want to somehow inject more information

baselines: harmonic mean of throughput, 

exp: compare wifi and lte


10000pkts,ping interval 5-30ms, xack interval 10- 100ms, rep 5,

try dnn and lstm

classify all latency into 5 bins: 0-50ms, 50-100ms, 100-150ms, 150-200ms

compare with linear regression, without probe, and no xack only normal ack (not implemented yet), a recursive least squares

nmodification to data collection: remove xack line; add size to latency.dat

need to make the accuracy of each class similar or priotize over a class
weighted cross entropy?

intuitively, when the latency is higher, the consequence of not detecting it should be higher

need to reduce class numbers so that each class will contain some samples

need to model the gain/loss of a successful prediction at a certain level.

how to determine the threshold of a jitter? lets assume we know latency of all packets (or we can detect them with high accuracy). Now we need to draw a threshold line to separate all packets into jitter/non-jitter. 

evaluation:
transmit 1000-10000 packets
set a threshold T
measure the number of packets that is predicted to arrive in time and is in fact in time N_{arrival}
measure the number of total sent packets
measure the metric of 1/threshold*sending effectiveness*sent size for different methods

for baseline that dont do any prediction, we can find the optimal threshold after getting the latency. However, the limitation is that the transmitted number always equals the total packet number while proposed method can reduce the transmitted number.

try different loss functions to improve results

the objective function can be different to get a different threshold

so now it becomes a two-class classification problem.

implement baseline methods

cross entropy or weighted cross entropy or else?
