quic vs dumbprefetch vs drop vs prefetch
0. run all 5x

1.change interval from 11ms to 15ms and run drop/prefetch 5x

2. change the buffer to 3,6,10 and run prefetch 5x

we could possibly compare the predicition accuracy from either only past frame statistics and XACK info

better protocol for latency sensitive applications in assym net?

the delayed packets are of less value compared to the common case, so we want to make the prediction accurate.

the feedback at the server is slow so we want to somehow inject more information

baselines: harmonic mean of throughput, 

exp: compare wifi and lte


10000pkts,ping interval 5-30ms, xack interval 10- 100ms, rep 5,

try dnn and lstm

classify all latency into 5 bins: 0-50ms, 50-100ms, 100-150ms, 150-200ms
